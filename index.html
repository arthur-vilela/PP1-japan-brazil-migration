                            agreement
                            with Japan took place in 1880, <a href="#reference-04">culminating in the signing of the
                                Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation in 1895</a>, which paved the way for
                            Japanese immigration. Despite this,
                            there
                            was
                            strong
                            prejudice against Asian immigrants, seen as inferior races who would threaten the <a

                            increased resistance, but the need for workers overcame these barriers.

                            Ryo Mizuno, president of the Imperial Emigration Company, visited Brazil in 1906, and the
                            contract to <a href="#reference-06">bring 3,000 Japanese immigrants was signed in 1907</a>,
                            despite
                            criticism. The São Paulo
                            government saw the Japanese as an alternative to fill the gap left by the Italians and solve
                            labor
                            conflicts, taking advantage of the Japanese workforce valued by positive reports of their

                            <p>The Kasato Maru is recognized as the first ship to bring Japanese immigrants to Brazil,
                                disembarking 781 people at the Port of Santos on June 18, 1908. After medical
                                examinations and Portuguese lessons, these immigrants went to work in the coffee
                                plantations of São Paulo. The reception was cold, with little praise, and many
                                immigrants, unaccustomed to farming, abandoned their jobs. In 1910, the Ryojun Maru
                                brought another 906 immigrants, bringing the number of Japanese in Brazil to 10,000 in
                                1914. The immigrants struggled to adapt, but through the "partnership farming" system,
                                they managed to save money and buy land. Many decided to stay in Brazil, forming
                                communities such as the Liberdade neighborhood in São Paulo.</p>

                            <p>After the First World War, the flow of Japanese immigrants to Brazil increased
                                significantly, with 164,000 arriving between 1917 and 1940, especially in the 1920s.
                                From 1930 onwards, the kôtakusei stood out, immigrants prepared by the Kokushikan Kôtô
                                Takushoku Gakkô in Tokyo to settle permanently in Brazil, not only to work, but also to
                                do research. Immigration to Brazil was stimulated by the United States' ban on the entry
                                of Japanese in 1924 and the restrictions imposed by other countries such as Australia
                                and Canada, as well as Japanese advertisements for getting rich quick in Brazil. As a
                                result, Brazil became one of the few countries to accept Japanese immigrants,
                                facilitating the growth of this community.</p>

                            <p>Japanese immigration to Brazil grew during the 1930s, with 75% of them settling in São
                                Paulo to work in coffee plantations, as well as other crops such as strawberries, tea
                                and rice. Small communities also sprang up in Pará, attracted by the cultivation of
                                black pepper. In the 1930s, Brazil was already home to the largest population of
                                Japanese outside Japan. In 1933, the National Constituent Assembly discussed the theses
                                of racial eugenics defended by doctors such as Miguel Couto, who proposed the
                                "whitening" of the Brazilian population and an end to Japanese immigration. In the 1934
                                census, the Japanese were the third nationality in terms of the number of agricultural
                                establishments in São Paulo, behind Brazilians and Italians. </p>

                            <p>The resulting Constitution established immigration quotas, allowing only 2% of the total
                                number of immigrants received in the last 50 years, except for the Portuguese. These
                                quotas restricted Japanese immigration and future immigration of Koreans and Chinese.
                                Japanese immigration was the subject of intense debate, with nationalist and racist
                                arguments against their entry, while defenders pointed to the agricultural productivity
                                of the Japanese. During Getúlio Vargas' Estado Novo, repression of immigrant culture
                                intensified, with confiscation of property and bans on political activities,
                                associations and the use of foreign languages. Japanese schools were closed and the
                                dissemination of information in the Japanese community was severely restricted.</p>

                            <p>The second generation of Japanese in Brazil gave up on returning to Japan, especially
                                after the outbreak of the Second World War in 1941, which made it impossible to leave
                                Brazil. During the war, community newspapers were closed down, and immigrants of German,
                                Italian and Japanese origin were considered "Axis subjects" and seen as "enemies" after
                                Brazil supported the US in 1942. At this time, repression against the Nikkei increased,
                                with looting and destruction of Japanese property, and they were often provocatively
                                referred to as the "fifth column".</p>

                            <p> Brazilian government took severe measures against the Japanese-Brazilians, including
                                a ban on traveling without a pass, closing schools, seizing radios, and restricting the
                                use of motor vehicles. Japanese companies were confiscated, including Banco América do
                                Sul. Japanese immigrants faced more intense discrimination than Italians and Germans,
                                with thousands being arrested or expelled on suspicion of espionage. Concentration camps
                                were set up, and immigrants were forced to move, mainly in Santos, due to unfounded
                                fears of espionage.</p>

                                to the difficulties reported by relatives. Most families opted to prepare their children
                                to rise in Brazilian society, resulting in a migration from the countryside to the
                                cities. The strong anti-Japanese sentiment continued beyond the end of the war, with
                                policies that favored European immigrants. In this context, Japanese-Brazilians began to
                                get more involved in politics, electing Yukishige Tamura as a state representative in
                                1950 and, later, other representatives. Fábio Riodi Yassuda became the first Nikkei to
                                be a minister in 1969.</p>

                            <p> In the 1950s, Japanese immigration began again, with almost 200,000 Japanese arriving in
                                Brazil by 1973. With the migration to urban areas, many Japanese-Brazilians dedicated
                                themselves to small businesses and basic services, such as dry cleaners. In the 1970s,
                                80% of the laundries in São Paulo were owned by Japanese. In addition, the education of
                                their children became a priority, with many entering technical courses and prestigious
                                colleges. By 1958, Japanese descendants accounted for 21% of Brazilians with higher
                                education. The city of São Paulo became the city with the largest number of Japanese
                                outside Japan, reflecting the integration and success of the Japanese-Brazilian
                                community.</p>

                            <p>From the end of the 1980s, an economic crisis in Brazil and Japanese demand for labor led
                                around 85,000 Japanese and their descendants to emigrate to Japan, forming the
                                dekassegui community. In 2008, approximately 300,000 Brazilians were living legally in
                                Japan, mainly as industrial workers in cities such as Hamamatsu, Aichi, Shizuoka,
                                Kanagawa, Saitama and Gunma. Brazil has more than 1.4 million people of Japanese origin,
                                with São Paulo having the largest concentration, totaling 326,000 Japanese-Brazilians,
                                according to the 1988 census.</p>

                    <h3>Cusine</h3>
                    <p>When the Japanese moved from the coffee plantations to the capital, they concentrated in the
                        Liberdade district. There, Japanese eateries sprang up in independent basements. The Japanese
                        introduced fruits and vegetables to Brazil that were unknown in local cuisine, cultivating
                        previously infertile areas and changing Brazilian eating habits. Japanese cuisine gained
                        popularity
                        mainly in the 1980s in São Paulo, where a large Japanese community lives, but it was in the
                        1990s
                        that Brazilians massively embraced this cuisine, appreciating its healthiness and taste. The
                        expansion of rodízios and the presence of sushi in many establishments illustrate the growing
                        demand, and in 2013 there were 600 Japanese restaurants in São Paulo compared to 500
                        steakhouses.
                    </p>

                    <p>Japanese cuisine has won many fans in Brazil, and restaurants have adapted their dishes to suit
                        the
                        local palate, creating versions such as hot rolls. Free buffets or rodízios made Japanese
                        cuisine
                        more accessible, with the first restaurant of this type opening in 1990 in Rio de Janeiro.
                        Fast-food
                        models, such as temakerias, have also become popular, with the first temakeria opening in São
                        Paulo
                        in 2003. In Japan, there are no rodízios or temakerias, highlighting the Brazilian adaptations
                        of
                        Japanese cuisine.</p>

                    <h3>Arts</h3>
                    <p>In the arts, Japanese-Brazilian culture has stood out in cinema with films such as "Gaijin - Os
                        Caminhos da Liberdade" , "Gaijin - Ama-me como Sou" , and "Corações Sujos" . In addition,
                        various
                        Japanese cultural events in Brazil, such as the Tanabata Matsuri in São Paulo, help to revive
                        and
                        promote age-old traditions, even among Brazilians of other origins. In the field of fine arts,
                        Japanese-Brazilians created the "Japanese-Brazilian school", with groups like Seibi-kai, founded
                        in
                        1935 in São Paulo, playing a crucial role in the evolution of the arts in Brazil. Seibi-kai
                        organized 14 annual art salons between 1952 and 1970, contributing significantly to the national
                        art
                        scene until its closure in 1972. Another relevant group was the Guanabara Group, formed by
                        Tikashi
                        Fukushima and other Japanese-Brazilian and Italian artists, active between 1950 and 1960.</p>

                    <p>Ceramics also had notable contributions from Japanese-Brazilian artists such as Kimi Nii,
                        internationally recognized and whose works were exhibited in Japan and at the Museum of Modern
                        Art
                        (MoMA) in New York. Hideko Honma became a national reference, standing out for her utilitarian
                        ceramics, which were prized by Brazilian architects and chefs. In cinema, Tizuka Yamasaki, a
                        Japanese-Brazilian filmmaker, founded her production company and directed award-winning films
                        such
                        as "Gaijin - Os Caminhos da Liberdade", receiving recognition in Brazil and abroad. In
                        literature,
                        Hidekazu Masuda Goga, an important diffuser of haiku, founded the Grêmio Haicai Ipê and was
                        awarded
                        for his work in spreading haiku internationally. On television, Japanese-Brazilian actors such
                        as
                        Daniele Suzuki face challenges of visibility and stereotypes, often being cast in caricatured
                        roles
                        that refer to their ethnic origin.</p>

                    <h3>Sports</h3>
                    <p>The Japanese influence in Brazil is also present in sport, especially through martial arts.
                        Sports
                        such as judo, karate, aikido and kendo were introduced by Japanese immigrants and became very
                        popular. Judo, in particular, stood out with the formation of several academies and associations
                        across the country, contributing to the development of high-level athletes who achieved
                        international recognition. Brazilian athletes such as Aurélio Miguel and Rafaela Silva became
                        Olympic champions, elevating judo to the status of one of Brazil's most successful sports in
                        international competitions. Another striking example is jiu-jitsu, which originated in Japan and
                        was
                        adapted and transformed in Brazil, evolving into the famous Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ), a
                        distinctive
                        style that has become a world reference. The practice of these martial arts not only promoted
                        discipline and respect, fundamental values of Japanese culture, but also helped social
                        integration
                        and health promotion among Brazilians.</p>

                    <p>In addition to martial arts, baseball is another sport that Japanese immigrants brought to
                        Brazil.
                        Although less popular than soccer, baseball has found a significant niche, especially among the
                        Japanese-Brazilian communities. Clubs and leagues were established, and cities like São Paulo
                        and
                        Bastos became centers of excellence for the sport. The Brazilian Baseball and Softball
                        Confederation
                        organizes championships and promotes participation in international competitions, showing the
                        growing professionalization of the sport in the country. The practice of baseball has not only
                        strengthened the cultural ties between Brazil and Japan, but has also contributed to the
                        diversity
                        of sports in the country, providing more options for young Brazilians to get involved in
                        physical
                        activities.</p>
